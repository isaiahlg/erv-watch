# Environmental Rights Watch

This is an app for visualizing data related to environmental rights violations data using Vite, React, and Deck.gl. It's based on the template for vite.js + React, and the GeoJsonLayer example from deck.gl. 


## Local Development Instructions
Clone this repo. 

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install
# bundle and serve the app with vite
npm run dev
```

### Basemap

The basemap in this example is provided by [CARTO free basemap service](https://carto.com/basemaps). To use an alternative base map solution, visit [this guide](https://deck.gl/docs/get-started/using-with-map#using-other-basemap-services)

## Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
